Let's break down the project description and create a full plan for the HTML, CS and JavaScript project. The goal of this project is to create a 5-page website using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and a bit of JavaScript for interactivity.

Project Overview:
    The website consists of 5 pages:
      1. HomePage (index.html)
      2. MenuPage (menu.html)
      3. AboutPage (about.html)
      4. ContactPage (contact.html)
      5. BookingPage (booking.html)
    Each page will be designed using basic HTML and CSS. The project will also include a bit of JavaScript for form validation or simple interactions where necessary.

Key Concepts:
   - HTML will be used to define the structure of each page.
   - CSS will be used to style the pages and make the website visually appealing.
   - JavaScript will be added for interactivity (like form validation).
    
Website Features:
    -  A navigation menu on each page to link to the other pages.
    - Consistent design across all pages using CSS.
    - Responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes (using CSS media queries).
    - Booking form with validation using JavaScript.
    - Basic content structure on each page (Home, Menu, About, Contact, and Booking).
